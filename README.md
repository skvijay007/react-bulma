Like most CSS frameworks out there, Bulma comes with styles for your common components and a series of customizations that can be accomplished by adding different classes to your elements.

react-bulma-components simplifies things further by providing components for each of the major elements, and eliminates the need for juggling class names in favor of passing in properties to your components.
